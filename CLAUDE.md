## initial development rules

- checkout the progress in SPEC/07-milestones.md.
- follow spec in ./SPEC dir to implement features.
- work feature by feature as per in SPEC/07-milestones.md and tick items once done.
- ask for user prompt if require to choose from multiple competing options.
- after one or few relevant features are implemented do a thorough review, fmt code and commit.
- after milestone, pause and wait until asked to advance to next milestone.
- implement test cases whereever possible.
- whatever changes are done, spec needs to be updated or atleast a note to be added in spec
